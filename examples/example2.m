%% Example 2: Steady-State Flow Recirculation Zone Around a Well Doublet
% Flow recirculation zones around one or more pairs of injection and extraction 
% wells are common in various groundwater flow, reservoir, and geothermal engineering 
% applications. Typical examples include capture zone delineation, forced-gradient 
% tracer tests for aquifer characterization, in-situ remediation of contaminated 
% groundwater, thermal assessments of open-loop well-doublet systems, seasonal 
% heat storage and recovery, and cold fluid reinjection into low-enthalpy geothermal 
% reservoirs. 
% 
% The purpose of this tutorial is to simulate steady-state flow patterns around 
% a pair of injection and pumping wells. 
% 
% We will follow these steps to create a simulation script that models the steady-state 
% flow patterns around a well doublet in a geothermal reservoir:
%% 
% # Set up the computational grid and wells.
% # Perform a steady-state flow and travel times simulations around the well 
% pair. 
% # Visualize flownets. 
% # Perform a three-way comparison against an analytical solution and another 
% numerical solution.
%% 
% We begin by clearing all variables in the workspace and then loading the relevant 
% length and time constant units.

clear;                              % Clear all variables in the workspace
setLengthUnitsInWorkspace();        % Set length units in the base workspace
setTimeUnitsInWorkspace(2024);      % Check for leap year and set time units 
%% Set up the computational grid and wells 
% Letâ€™s define the simple aquifer geometry, which consists of a one-layer model 
% measuring 6000 m x 6000 m x 25 m in each spatial dimension. For this model, 
% we will use a uniform grid spacing of 25 m in all directions.

Grid = cartGrid(0:25:6000, 0:25:6000, 0:25:25);
%% 
% Consider a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer characterized by the following 
% uniform properties:

% Cell-wise hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer
Grid.properties.hydraulic_conductivity = (0.8365*meter/day) * ones(3, Grid.Nx, Grid.Ny, Grid.Nz);

% Cell-wise porosity of the aquifer
Grid.properties.porosity = 0.25*ones(Grid.Nx,Grid.Ny,Grid.Nz);
%% 
% Create a second 2D grid for visualization purposes:

% Planar two-dimensional grid to be used for subsequent visualizations
G2D = cartGrid(0:25:6000, 0:25:6000);
%% 
% We set the injection and production flow rates to 150$m^3/h$.

Q  = 150*meter^3/hour;             % conversion from m^3/h to m^3/s
wells_pos = [91,150];              % cell no's of the injection and production wells respectively

% Add injection well 
W = verticalWell([], Grid, 91, 1, 1, Q, 'type', 'injection', 'name', 'I');

% Add pumping well 
W = verticalWell(W, Grid, 150, 1, 1, Q, 'type', 'pumping', 'name', 'P');
%% Steady-state Flow and Travel Times Simulations
% We execute the steady-state flow model, followed by travel time simulations 
% in both directions. Subsequently, we deduce the residence time distribution 
% in the aquifer. 

% Call flow solver
tic; [h,V] = head(Grid, W); toc;
% Travel time simulations
ftt = travelTime(Grid, V, W, true);
btt = travelTime(Grid, V, W, false);

% Calculate residence time 
rt = ftt + btt;
%% Flownets Visualization 
% To visualize the flownets, we begin by plotting the equipotential lines of 
% the computed hydraulic heads. Next, we plot selected iso-contours of the residence 
% time to generate streamlines using the DDA.

% As expected, the flow pattern is perfectly symmetrical along the median y-axis 
% of the rectangular domain, and the contour lines are orthogonal to the no-flow 
% boundaries and equipotential lines, consistent with classical groundwater flownet 
% theory. 
%% Three-way Comparison using an Analytical Solution and another Numerical Solution
% In this section, we conduct a three-way comparison study. The streamlines 
% computed using the DDA will be compared to those obtained from another numerical 
% method and then to an available analytical solution.

% Comparison against an analytical solution
% When examining groundwater flow in homogeneous and isotropic confined aquifers, 
% Bear [1] and Strack [3] utilized complex potential theory to analytically derive 
% expressions for the discharge potential, $\Phi$, and stream function, $\Psi$, 
% components assuming Dupuit-Forchheimer conditions. The complex potential is 
% defined as follows:
% 
% $$\Omega(z) = \Phi(z) + i \Psi(z)$$
% 
% where $z=x+iy$ is the coordinate in the complex plane. 
% 
% In the recirculation zone created by a pair of injection and extraction wells 
% in the absence of regional flow, these functions are expressed as follows: 
% 
% $$\Phi(x,y) = \frac{Q}{4\pi} \ln [\frac{(x-d)^2+y^2}{(x+d)^2+y^2}]$$
% 
% $$\Psi(x,y) = \frac{Q}{2\pi}[\arctan(\frac{y}{x-d})-\arctan (\frac{y}{x+d})]$$
% 
% where $d$is the half-distance between the wells.
% 
% The equipotential lines are concentric circles centered around the injection 
% and production wells. Their analytical expressions, as derived by Strack [3], 
% are given by:
% 
% $[x+d\coth(\frac{2\pi\Phi}{Q})]^2 + y^2 = \frac{d^2}{\sinh^2(\frac{2\pi\Phi}{Q})}$   
% if  $\Phi \ne 0$
% 
% $x=0$                                                  if $\Phi = 0$
% 
% The streamlines also have circular shapes, with their centers located along 
% the median vertical axis between the well pair. They are analytically expressed 
% as follows: 
% 
% $x^2 + [y-d\cot(\frac{2\pi\Psi}{Q})]^2 = \frac{d^2}{sin^2(\frac{2\pi\Psi}{Q})}$   
% if $\Psi \ne 0, \pm\frac{Q}{2}$ 
% 
% $y=0$                                             if $\Psi = 0, \pm\frac{Q}{2}$
% 
% It is straightforward to show that the coordinates of the streamline, $\Psi$, 
% center are $[0,d\cot(2\pi\Psi/Q)]$and its radius is $d/|\sin(2\pi\Psi/Q)|$. 
% The height of the streamline arc is given by $h_s = d\tan(\frac{\pi}{2}-\frac{\pi|\psi|}{Q})$[2].
% 
% Now, let's calculate the $\Psi$ levels of the numerically computed streamlines 
% based on their prescribed heights: 

d   = G2D.coord(wells_pos(2),1)-G2D.coord(wells_pos(1),1); d = d/2;
psi = Q*((pi/2)-atan(Ypos/d))/pi;
%% 
% Next, we plot a few points for the corresponding circles of each streamline. 

rc = d./abs(sin(2*pi*psi/Q));
yc = d*cot(2*pi*psi/Q);
xp = []; yp = [];
for i=1:numel(rc)
    xp = [xp rc(i)*cos(-pi:pi/21:pi)+6000/2]; 
    yp = [yp rc(i)*sin(-pi:pi/21:pi)+yc(i)]; 
end    
plot(xp, yp, 'ko', 'MarkerSize',4);
% Comparison against another numerical solution
% In this section, we will use MATLAB's built-in |streamline| function to compute 
% similar streamlines. This function is called directly from the |plotStreamlines| 
% command in this toolbox. Internally, the |streamline| function performs numerical 
% integration to trace the streamlines by solving the system of ordinary differential 
% equations that describe particle motion in the specific discharge field. MATLAB 
% employs a variant of Runge-Kutta methods to solve these ODEs, which are commonly 
% used for numerical integration, though the process is abstracted from the user. 
% The solver automatically adjusts the step size to maintain accuracy while tracing 
% the path. As a result, this approach falls into the category of numerically 
% computed streamlines, in contrast to those derived analytically using Pollock's 
% method.
% 
% To be sure we are comparing the same streamlines, we first extract all intersection 
% points between the streamlines simulated with the DDA. Nest, we trace forward 
% and backward particle paths from these positions. 

hold on;
% now plot numerically computed streamlines using Matlab integration
gs = [G2D.hx, G2D.hy];                     % uniform grid sizes along X & Y
sx = 3000*ones(1,length(Ypos));            % streamlines starting x positions
hp = plotStreamline(V,gs,[sx;Ypos],true);  % plot streamlines in forward direction ...
set(hp,'Color','r','LineWidth',0.8);       %    with blue color 
hi = plotStreamline(V,gs,[sx;Ypos],false); % plot streamlines in backward direction ...
set(hi,'Color','r','LineWidth',0.8);       %    with red color
%% 
% Finally we customize the final plot.

%% 
% The two numerical solutions are in perfect agreement, except for small discrepancies 
% near the wells. Nonetheless, all streamlines correctly diverge from the injection 
% well and converge toward the pumping well, as dictated by the physics of groundwater 
% flow. These results demonstrate that the implementation of the DDA is both correct 
% and accurate. The DDA offers a potential improvement over particle tracking 
% as an alternative method.
% 
% As shown in the previous figure, the agreement between the numerically computed 
% streamlines (plotted as solid lines) and the analytically calculated streamlines 
% (represented by circles) is quite good. However, the quality of this agreement 
% diminishes for the longest streamlines connecting the wells on both sides.
% 
% This discrepancy arises from boundary condition artifacts, as these streamlines 
% approach the closed domain boundaries. In numerical simulations, particularly 
% those involving confined aquifers, the finite boundaries of the model can influence 
% the flow patterns, leading to deviations from expected behaviors. Unlike the 
% analytical solution, which assumes an infinite domain, numerical methods must 
% account for these boundaries, potentially resulting in distortions in the representation 
% of the flow field. As streamlines near the domain edges, they may become influenced 
% by the artificial constraints imposed by the model boundaries, causing them 
% to diverge from the analytically derived results.
% 
% Itâ€™s important to highlight that this disagreement does not indicate a lack 
% of accuracy in the DDA. In fact, the DDA results closely align with those obtained 
% from another numerical simulation method, suggesting that the DDA is robust 
% and reliable in modeling groundwater flow. The observed discrepancies serve 
% as a reminder of the limitations inherent in numerical modeling, particularly 
% when dealing with boundary effects.
